This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `CAVEATS`

I used CreateReactApp so there's no evidence of my understanding of webpack
Although I do have it.

I did not use a CSS pre-processor, I generally use post-css and node modules
I didn't want to ramp up on the pre-processor

Styling is pretty barren

While pretty responsive, I didn't full optimize for modal

There is much functionality that is not implemented.

There are no tests.

I don't have prettier setup on this computer so formatting
could be a bit rough.

### `Reasoning`

I spend a LOT of time on this despite all of the above.
I had very little scaffolding for react/redux apps. While
I have several sometimes it takes as long to tear out
irrelivant stuff from an existing app as it does to just write everything.

Given how long this took, I don't know that I spent enough time on
architecture/design.  In a real app or as an app develops I think
there would be some changes.
